# BobaTones

Interactive app where you click on the screen and generate boba (currently capped at 10) and watch it bounce around on your screen and interact with each other.

To check this out: 
```
1. Clone or Fork this repo.
2. npm install
3. npm run start
4. Check it out at localhost:8080
```

This app was built using Tone.js and Paper.js. Paper.js was used to generate the boba on click and Tone.js was used to create the music and sound effects.
Credits in `shape.js` for some music elements.
